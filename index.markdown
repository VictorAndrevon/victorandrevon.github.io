# Where Dreams Go to Die?  
### NYC Business Closures During COVID

New York City has always been a place where ambition collides with opportunity — a city built by small businesses, corner cafés, and immigrant-run shops. But the COVID-19 pandemic cracked that foundation.

Suddenly, entire streets lost their pulse. Shuttered stores became the norm, not the exception. From SoHo to the South Bronx, dreams dissolved into “For Rent” signs. But was this collapse temporary? Or did something fundamental change in how NYC works, shops, and survives?

This data story investigates that question.

Using datasets from NYC Open Data, the NYC Independent Budget Office, and the city’s own COVID-19 relief trackers, we explore what happened to the city’s business landscape — and whether it has returned to “normal.”

## 📊 Our Central Question

**Did NYC’s small business ecosystem recover — or did COVID permanently alter the city’s economic heartbeat?**

To answer that, we follow three storylines:

1. [🕓 A Business Rollercoaster: Trends Over Time](/trend-analysis)  
   → How did the number of businesses rise, fall, and rebound?

2. [🗺️ Neighborhoods Left Behind](/spatial-patterns)  
   → Which areas were hit hardest — and which bounced back?

3. [🏛️ The Role of Policy: Did Relief Efforts Work?](/policy-impact)  
   → Did government intervention help stabilize or restore the business landscape?

Each section combines **public data, real-world locations, and analytical visuals** to uncover how NYC changed — and whether it’s still changing.

- **Issued Business Licenses**  
  NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection

## 💬 Why It Matters

Small businesses are more than economics — they’re the fabric of a city. They reflect who lives here, what communities value, and who has access to opportunity.

By visualizing the timeline, geography, and policy response to business closures, this story helps us understand:

- Who survived the shock — and who didn’t?
- Did public policy mitigate the worst effects?
- Are we witnessing a slow recovery — or a permanent reset?
