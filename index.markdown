# Where Dreams Go to Die?  
### COVID-19 and the Fate of NYC’s Storefronts

When the pandemic hit New York City, it didn’t just bring a health crisis—it reshaped the city’s economy at the street level. Restaurants, barbershops, corner stores—many of the businesses that gave neighborhoods their character—closed overnight. Four years later, some never returned.

This project explores one core question:

> **Did NYC’s small-business ecosystem truly recover, or did the pandemic leave a permanent scar?**

Using data from NYC Open Data, local policy archives, and vacancy reports, this interactive, three-part story— moving from city-wide trends to neighborhood-specific patterns to the policies that shaped them.

## What the Numbers Reveal

- Business license registrations fell by **43% between 2019 and 2021**—the sharpest two-year decline on record.  
- **One-third of storefronts in operation today opened _after_ Q1 2020**, reflecting churn, not stability.  
- Midtown and FiDi still report **double-digit vacancy rates** in both retail and office space.  
- By contrast, **SoHo saw a strong rebound**, with retail vacancy falling from 34.6% to 11.5% between 2021–2024.  
- Relief distribution was **deeply uneven**: Manhattan captured 63% of city-run grants, while the Bronx got the fewest.  

It wasn’t only a slow recovery—it was uneven

## Why This Matters

Small businesses are more than economic units—they’re part of what holds neighborhoods together. But after COVID, some areas rebounded quickly. Others didn’t. This raises uncomfortable questions:

- Did aid go where it was most needed—or where it was easiest to deliver?  
- Are we seeing a recovery—or is opportunity drifting away from certain communities?
- Who’s rebuilding, and who’s being priced out of their own comeback?

Understanding what happened isn’t just about looking back. It’s about deciding what kind of city comes next.
