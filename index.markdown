# Where Dreams Go to Die?  
### COVID-19 and the Fate of NYC’s Storefronts

New York City once ran on the hum of corner bodegas, 24-hour diners, and mom-and-pop boutiques. Then March 2020 arrived. Within weeks, foot traffic collapsed, office towers emptied, and “For Lease” signs outnumbered open signs. Four years later, the city is busier—but is it the same? **This project asks one driving question:**

> **Did NYC’s small-business ecosystem _truly_ recover, or did the pandemic leave a permanent scar?**

To answer, we traced every business license issued or surrendered since 2018, mapped vacancies block-by-block, and overlaid billions of dollars in relief spending. What emerged is a three-part story you can _explore_—zooming from a city-wide sweep down to single streets, and pulling up details on demand.

## 📍 Overview First: What the Numbers Say

* Business registrations plunged **43 % between 2019 and 2021**—the steepest two-year fall on record. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
* **One in three storefronts that exist today opened _after_ Q1 2020**, proof of churn rather than full revival. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
* Manhattan’s retail corridors still show **vacancy above 11 %—almost double pre-COVID levels**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
* The Financial District’s office core reports **15.5 % empty office space**; cafés and service shops remain sparse. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
* SoHo, by contrast, rebounded fast—vacancy falling from **34.6 % in 2021 to 11.5 % by late 2024**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
* Relief money flowed unequally: Manhattan firms captured **63 % of City–run grants**, while the Bronx saw the fewest awards. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

These patterns hint at unequal recovery—but the data is richer than a headline.

## 👀 Why It Matters

Small businesses are the city’s social fabric: they employ half the private workforce and anchor street-level life. Yet relief dollars, zoning flexibilities, and foot-traffic realities have created **winners and losers**. Unequal rebounds raise hard policy questions:

* Are hybrid work patterns dooming central business districts?  
* Did relief programs cushion closures—or simply delay them?  
* Which communities still carry the heaviest economic burden?

The answers aren’t just academic: they shape which blocks thrive, whose cultural landmarks survive, and where future entrepreneurs dare to sign a lease.
