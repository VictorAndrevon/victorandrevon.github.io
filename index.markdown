# Understanding Drug Arrest Patterns in San Francisco

*Final Project for Data Visualization and Communication – DTU*

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This project explores drug-related arrest patterns in San Francisco over the past 20 years using open police incident data. By analyzing spatial and temporal trends, we aim to shed light on how policies and policing strategies may have shifted across different neighborhoods and time periods.

---

## 🎯 Research Question

**How have drug-related arrest patterns changed over time and space in San Francisco, and what might this tell us about law enforcement priorities and urban policy?**

---

## 🗺️ Data Sources

- **San Francisco Open Data Portal**: [https://data.sfgov.org](https://data.sfgov.org)
- Dataset: Arrests data (location + timestamp)

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

### 1. **Time Series: Arrests Over Time**
*(Static/interactive line chart showing trends by year/month)*

### 2. **Map: Arrest Locations**
*(Heatmap or point map highlighting hotspots)*

### 3. **Interactive Bokeh Plot**
*(Hourly + district-based arrest pattern with zoom/pan)*

## 🧪 Preliminary Findings

- Arrests show a consistent **daily rhythm**, peaking in the late afternoon.
- The **Tenderloin**, **Mission**, and **Southern** districts are consistently overrepresented.
- Recent years may indicate a strategic focus on central areas.

---

## 📚 Data Story Genre

This project is presented as a **drill-down explanatory narrative**, allowing readers to first see high-level trends, then explore patterns within specific time frames and neighborhoods.

---

## 📁 Deliverables

- ✅ A narrative website (this one!)
- ✅ Jupyter notebook with full analysis (available [here](link-to-notebook-if-hosted))
- 🎬 1-minute concept video (submitted to DTU Learn)
