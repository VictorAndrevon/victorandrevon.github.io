# Who Was Left Behind?

As New York City declared itself open for business after the pandemic, the reality on the ground revealed a more complex story. While storefronts reopened and economic activity resumed in many parts of the city, countless others—especially in historically underserved communities—were left behind. Minority- and immigrant-owned businesses faced multiple challenges, from reduced access to relief funding to higher closure rates and slower rebounds.

Drawing on NYC Open Data, SBS-certified business records, and COVID-era grant distributions, this analysis examines how public policy met—or failed to meet—the needs of the city’s most vulnerable business owners. It reveals a narrative of disparity, missed opportunities, and the lasting impact of an uneven recovery.

## Policy on Paper, Gaps in Practice

In response to the economic fallout of the pandemic, city and federal authorities introduced a range of aid initiatives—including Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, SBS emergency grants, and neighborhood support funds—to help small businesses recover. Despite billions being allocated, access to these resources was far from equitable.  Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs), in particular, encountered significant barriers in obtaining relief. As outlined in the [the NYC Comptroller’s MWBE Recovery Report](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/minority-and-women-owned-businesses-at-risk-impact-of-covid-19-on-new-york-city-firms/), structural inequalities and systemic challenges limited these businesses’ ability to benefit from federal and local recovery efforts, leaving many without the support needed to survive and rebuild.

> According to a 2020 survey by the NYC Comptroller’s Office, most M/WBEs struggled to access public aid:
>
> - **Only 6 out of 40 applicants** were approved for the City’s Business Continuity Loan.
> - **Only 15 out of 48 applicants** were approved for the Employee Retention Grant.
> - Barriers included **restrictive criteria**, **lack of outreach**, and **fear of debt**.

## Disparity in Dollars: Who Got What?

The distribution of COVID relief money reveals further disparity. By linking SBS-certified businesses to grant disbursements by ZIP code, it becomes clear that aid per business varied significantly by race, ethnicity, and location.

In the Bronx, for example, Hispanic-owned businesses received an average of $27,440 in aid—while non-minority firms in Manhattan received over $60,000. Native American and Asian-owned businesses received even less on average, despite being concentrated in areas heavily impacted by closures.

This uneven distribution suggests that eligibility on paper did not translate to access in practice. Gaps in digital infrastructure, language accessibility, and financial literacy likely deepened the divide.

## More Money, More Survival?

Was greater aid a lifeline? To answer that, the relationship between financial support and actual business continuity must be explored.

By analyzing license records before and after March 2020, a “retention rate” was computed for each Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA)—the percentage of pre-COVID businesses still active afterward. These rates were then matched with the amount of aid received and the number of certified businesses in each area.

The data paints a concerning trend. In several Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs), even significant aid still saw less than half of businesses survive. In areas like BK09 and BX05, retention remained near 50% despite hundreds of thousands in grants. This suggests that while aid was critical, it was often insufficient on its own—particularly without parallel support in the form of technical assistance, legal help, or rent relief.

## Tracking Business Losses

While immediate closures drew early attention, longer-term survivorship reveals deeper challenges. A set of businesses that opened before March 2020 was tracked across subsequent years, revealing borough-level trends in business endurance.

The Bronx saw over 30% of its pre-pandemic businesses close by 2025, while Queens and Manhattan showed comparatively stronger retention. Brooklyn and Staten Island experienced gradual but steady declines.
hese patterns make clear that recovery was not a singular moment, but an extended, uneven process—one that many businesses, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods, struggled to sustain over time.

## Lessons for Future Crises

The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical role of neighborhood businesses in maintaining community resilience. Commissioner Dynishal Gross of the NYC Department of Small Business Services emphasized this point during a City Council hearing:

> “The effective operation of businesses that provide critical goods and services for neighborhoods is also an aspect of resilience... When things get hard for the city, those neighborhood businesses provide the access we need.”  
> — Commissioner Dynishal Gross, NYC Department of Small Business Services  
> *[City Council Testimony via citymeetings.nyc]*

Building on this understanding, the Adams administration implemented targeted investments to strengthen commercial corridors. In **February 2025**, SBS announced **$5.3 million in grants** aimed at merchant organizing and Business Improvement District (BID) support—designed to empower local organizations that intimately understand their communities’ needs. As Commissioner Gross explained:

> “By putting money into the hands of the people and organizations who know their communities best, we are ensuring that our investments in neighborhood development make the biggest impact possible on the health of our city’s economy.”  
> — Commissioner Dynishal Gross, NYC Department of Small Business Services  
> *[NYC.gov – SBS Press Release, Feb 2025]*

These efforts signal a move toward more equitable, community-informed recovery strategies. To build on this progress, future economic policy should:

- **Integrate demographic overlays** to guide aid distribution, ensuring resources reach the most affected populations.
- **Collaborate with MWBE networks and community partners** to improve outreach and trust.
- **Develop digital and multilingual infrastructure** to remove access barriers for diverse entrepreneurs.

The pandemic revealed systemic weaknesses that disproportionately impacted vulnerable entrepreneurs. Addressing them demands intentional, data-informed, and inclusive policy.
