# 🕓 Trend Analysis  
### From Boom to Bust—and Back? NYC’s Business Licensing Trends, 2017–2025

When the city that never sleeps hit pause in March 2020, the effects rippled far beyond Broadway and Wall Street. From nail salons in Queens to delis in the Bronx, small businesses across New York shuttered in numbers not seen in decades. But how deep was the collapse—and how strong was the rebound that ensued?

To find out, we analyzed every business license issued in NYC from 2017 through April 2025 using data from the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP), via NYC Open Data. We cross-referenced this with official city COVID-19 case wave data and lockdown timelines [source: NYC Health Department, 2020–2022].

Looking at the Licence Issuance numbers gives a clear picture of a multi-phased story that coincides with the evolution of the pendemic. 

## 📉 The Crash: 2020’s Licensing Freefall

Between 2019 and 2021, business license issuances dropped a staggering **43%**, from 3,663 in 2019 to just 2,232 in 2020. This marks the steepest two-year decline on record since the early 2000s. Unsurprisingly, the sharpest dip coincides with NYC’s first lockdown in March 2020, when non-essential businesses were ordered to close, and consumer activity collapsed overnight.

> According to the license data, **March–May 2020** saw issuance numbers plunge by over 60% compared to the same months in 2019. Even by year-end, the numbers had not fully rebounded.

COVID-19 case waves directly mirrored business hesitation: second and third waves in Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 coincided with further drops in licensing. The hesitancy was palpable: entrepreneurs were holding back, unsure of what kind of city they’d be investing in.

## 🔁 The Rebound: Cautious Optimism (2021–2024)

Licensing began to rebound in 2021, with **4,156 licenses issued**, almost doubling the previous year. Growth continued into 2022 and 2023, reaching **5,865 new licenses by 2023**, the highest count since the pre-pandemic peak of 2018 (5,263 licenses).

2024 followed closely behind with 5,506 new licenses, showing that while NYC may have been bruised, it wasn’t broken. Entrepreneurs returned with new priorities and perhaps a different appetite for risk.

But the rebound wasn’t uniform.

## 👤 Premises vs. Individuals: The Gig Economy Strikes Back?

DCWP licenses fall into two broad categories: **"Premises"** (tied to physical locations like storefronts) and **"Individual"** (issued to people, such as tour guides or contractors).

| Year | Individual Licenses | Premises Licenses |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 2021 | 532                  | 3,624             |
| 2022 | 1,506                | 3,653             |
| 2023 | 2,003                | 3,862             |
| 2024 | 1,742                | 3,764             |
| 2025 (partial) | 403        | 1,232             |

This trend tells a revealing story. While physical stores did rebound, **individual licenses grew at a much faster rate**. During the 3rd quarter of 2020, which coincides with the beginning of NYC's reopening phase III, the issuance rate grew by 500% for individual licenses compared to only 100% for premises license. This points to a post-pandemic shift: from brick-and-mortar to **gig and service-based work**.

Tour guides, home contractors, mobile vendors, and even remote workers may be fueling this “solo entrepreneur” resurgence. In essence, NYC's recovery wasn't just about re-opening storefronts—it was about **re-inventing work**.

## 🔍 What Type of Work Came Back?

The top business categories for new licenses in this period paint a clear picture of economic reconfiguration. Based on our breakdown of over 63,000 licenses, the most common categories were:

- **Home Improvement Contractor** – 17,147 licenses  
- **Tobacco Retail Dealer** – 6,234 licenses  
- **Secondhand Dealer – General** – 4,914 licenses  
- **Electronics Store** – 3,828 licenses  
- **Sightseeing Guide** – 3,490 licenses

Between the end of lockdown in June 2020 to the end of 2022, these sectors saw a massive increase in licenses issued. For sightseeing guides and pedicab drivers, the return of tourists after a period of international crisis directly translated into more job opportunities. For stores and retailers, the end of lockdown marked a comeback to regular shopping and consumption habits among New-Yorkers. Home Improvement Contractors, on the other hand, benefited from the durable shift to home-office and remote working.

## 🛑 Expired, Surrendered, or Closed: What Didn't Survive?

As of April 2025, the license status breakdown looks like this:

- **Active:** 35,471  
- **Expired:** 12,599  
- **Ready for Renewal:** 7,181  
- **Surrendered:** 1,998  
- **Failed to Renew:** 4,719  
- **Out of Business:** 61  
- **Revoked, Suspended, or Voided:** 1,174 combined

These figures suggest that while the city saw new openings, **thousands of businesses did not survive past renewal**. Surrendered and failed-to-renew licenses account for **over 6,700 businesses**, indicating the long tail of pandemic pain.

## 📆 Timeline Highlights (2017–2025)

We aggregated monthly and yearly license issuance to visualize the pandemic's full arc:

- **2018–2019:** Pre-COVID boom, peaking at 5,263 licenses in 2018.  
- **2020:** Collapse to 2,232 licenses amid full lockdown.  
- **2021:** Start of rebound (4,156 licenses).  
- **2022–2024:** Near full recovery with 5,159 (2022), 5,865 (2023), 5,506 (2024).  
- **2025 (so far):** 1,635 licenses as of April, trending slightly down, possibly seasonally.

The pattern suggests a new plateau—not quite the same as 2018's boom, but no longer the uncertainty of 2020.

## 🧭 What This Tells Us

New York’s post-COVID business recovery isn’t just about volume—it’s about **who** is opening, **how** they’re operating, and **what types** of work are rising.

- The **rise of individual licenses** reflects a shift to a **freelance/gig economy**.
- Home repairs, tourism, and niche retail sectors (like tobacco and electronics) saw the fastest rebounds.
- Despite significant gains, the pandemic's long-term scars—visible in surrendered and expired licenses—are still healing.

While the skyline may look the same, the **economic DNA of NYC’s street-level economy has evolved**. Understanding this change isn’t just about measuring recovery—it’s about preparing for what comes next.
